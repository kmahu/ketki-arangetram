                    <h2>MALLARI</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="musician-p">Mallari is an invocatory piece whose origin comes from temples wherein a diety 
                        was carried in a procession. The rhythmic beats guide the dancer’s steps using only sound and 
                        no words. Commonly performed in the beginning of the performance, the Mallari includes a greeting 
                        to the Gods, Guru, and audience.

                <h2>PRANAVAKAARAM</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="musician-p">Another name of Lord Ganesha, Pranavakaaram is the form of OM and the following 
                    phrase “Siddhi Vinayakam” celebrates him as the giver of blessings. Composer OotukkaaDu 
                    VenkaTasubbaiyyar wrote of the Lord’s smiling face and glorious dance to the beat of drums. 
                    Known to grant boons and remove obstacles, Ganesha is honored in this dance through a mixture of
                    Bhava and Nritta.

                <h2>JATISWARAM</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="musician-p">Composed by the Tanjore Quartet, Jatiswaram is an extremely traditional piece 
                    in the Bharatanatyam margam. The dance is beautiful in its simplicity and frames the ragam and 
                    taalam to which patterns are performed.

                    <h2>RAMAYANAM VARNAM </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="musician-p">The centerpiece of the Arangetram is a full depiction of the story of Rama and 
                        his victory against the evil Ravana. This varnam follows Rama from his first encounter with aruras 
                        to his adventures with hanuman, all while weaving fast-paced jathis into the intricate storytelling.
                        A test of stamina and skill, the varnam is a captivating journey on stage that embodies the soul of dance.

                <h2>SHANKARA SRI GIRI</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="musician-p">Shankara  Sri Giri is a powerful dance that highlights Lord Shiva’s cosmic dance and 
                    the  flowing waters of Ganga in his matted hair. He is described performing in front of the ganas
                    alongside Goddess Parvati to the beats of Nandi.

            <h2>OMKAR SWARUPA</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="musician-p">In this tribute to the Guru, who’s worth can never be counted or reached, the dancer conveys 
                the wealth of knowledge and enlightenment that is within a teacher. It isn’t possible to put devotion to one’s
                 guru into words and is instead shown through traditional tales. One detailing the exchange between Arjuna and 
                 Krishna, in front of the battle field, and the other retelling the tale of Sant Eknath, the composer, and 
                 his disciple “Polya”.

                <h2> THILLANA</h2>
                <br>
                <p class="musician-p">Thillana is a mostly nritta piece, composed in the ragam Kaapi with brisk 
                    adavu and footwork in a pallavi-anupallavi-charanam structure. Typically done at the end of a 
                    program, the dance is exciting to watch and perform, ending with a charanam that praises the
                     Devi who resides everywhere we can see and in nature.

                    <h2>AIGIRI NANDINI </h2>
                    <br>
                    <p class="musician-p">Aigiri Nandini celebrates the Goddess Parvati as a Mangalam, which is the final 
                        dance. The opening lines of Aigiri Nandani are translated to "O Daughter of the Mountain" a 
                        popular stotrum honoring the devi, slayer of the arusa Mahishasura. In the piece, Mahishasura 
                        runs rampant on earth and hearing the pleas  of her devotees, Goddess Parvati descends from 
                        the mountain to stop him. The beautiful devi baits the asura into fighting her and reveals her 
                        true might in the height of battle.
