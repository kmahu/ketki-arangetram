                rhythm. She has learnt the basics of carnatic music from Ajay Ananthanarayanan in 
                Philadelphia and Nalini Anantharaman in Chennai. Anjali is also mentored by 
                percussionists like BC Manjunath, Sv Balakrishna, and Lakshman Mahadevan in Konnakol.

                creating awareness about Bharatanatyam and Indian culture through quality instruction, 
                public performances, workshops and educational presentations.She acknowledges her 
                sincere thanks to her Gurus for her expert guidance and her parents who have identified
                 and greatly encouraged her in making her dreams a reality. She greatly appreciates
                  her husband and her extended family without whose cooperation and support, pursuing 
                  her passion would have been impossible.
