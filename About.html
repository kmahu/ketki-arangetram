        <b><h4>HISTORY OF BHARATNATYAM</h4></b>  <br>
        <p>
            Known to be one of India’s oldest yet still practiced dance forms, Bharatanatyam hails from the state of Tamil Nadu in South India. 
            The name of the art is drawn from Bharata, a sage who wrote the treatise Nātyaśāstra which was exposed to his hundred sons. Partly 
            responsible for preserving Bharatanatyam was the institution of the Devidāsīs, who were servants dedicated to God through dance and music. 
            Many young dancers grew up in the temples telling stories of mythology to audiences. Kings and royal courts had a great influence in the 
            progression of the dance form, particularly during the Marata rule of King Sahaji and his Marathi Padamas. Bharatanatyam reached its 
            permanent structure from the Tanjore Quartet: royal musicians in the court of Raja Sarfoji. The concepts of Bharatanatyam have certainly 
            traveled far from Ancient India to its place on the global dance stage.

        <b><h4>ARANGETRAM</h4></b><br>
        <p>
            The literal definition of Arangetram means “rising to the stage”, an allusion to the debut of a dancer or singer. An Arangetram provides 
            a stage to showcase the development of an artist with the blessing of their Guru(s) and is a symbol of accomplishment. In the case of 
            Bharatanatyam, this typically means the dancer has completed a mārgam or repertoire of about eight songs, including some traditional 
            dances like Alarippu, Jatiswaram, and Thillana. Dance is accompanied by music, commonly in the form of instruments like the mrdangam, 
            veena, sruti, and cymbals. Thank you for participating in this lifelong achievement!
            laborum.

        <b><h4>KETKI</h4> </b><br>
        <p>
            Ketki Mahurkar started Bharatanatyam at the age of five under the tutelage of Shreemati Pavitra Krishnan in Torrance, California. 
            As she studied there, she fell deeper in love with the world of dance and took classes, not only in Bharatanatyam, but also in a mix of 
            hip hop, ballet, and bollywood. After moving to the DFW area in 2016, Ketki immediately started learning again, this time with 
            Shreemati Anjali Nandan. She is now completing her 12th year of Bharatanatyam and has attained a basic certification in the art. 
            Ketki enjoys sharing the beauty of Bharatanatyam with others as well and frequently assists in teaching younger students of her Guru. 
            Currently, she is diving into the college admissions process with hopes of getting a degree related to graphic design.
